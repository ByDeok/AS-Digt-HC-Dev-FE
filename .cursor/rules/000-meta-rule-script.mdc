# META RULES: UNIVERSAL PROJECT PRINCIPLES

## Core Principles
- **Maintainability**: Prioritize code clarity, modularity, and documentation
- **Scalability**: Design for growth in users, data, and features
- **Security**: Security-first approach with proper validation and error handling
- **Quality**: Comprehensive testing, code reviews, and continuous improvement

## Development Approach
- Define problems clearly before solving
- Use established patterns and best practices
- Document decisions and changes transparently
- Implement proper error handling, logging, and monitoring

## Project Organization
- Maintain clear hierarchical structure (rules, docs, code)
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Separate concerns into logical domains
- Keep documentation concise and focused
