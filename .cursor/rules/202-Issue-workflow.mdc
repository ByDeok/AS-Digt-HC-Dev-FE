# Issue Workflow Standard

This rule defines the standard operating procedure for the AI agent and developer collaboration, covering task definition, issue generation, development, and pull request automation.

## 1. Task Definition & Issue Creation

### Task Definition
- Create task descriptions in markdown format under `studio/Tasks/`.
- File naming convention: `issue-{number}-{short-description}.md`.
- Content must include a clear Title (H1) and Body (Description, Requirements, Checklist).

### Issue Generation
- Use the `create_issues.ps1` script located in the workspace root.
- The script utilizes `gh` CLI to:
  - Create issues in the remote repository.
  - Prevent duplicate issue creation.
  - Automatically apply the `Issue Automation` label.
- **Command**: `.\create_issues.ps1`

## 2. Development Cycle

### Branching
- Create a new branch for each issue.
- Use prefixes based on the work type: `feat/`, `fix/`, `refactor/`, `chore/`.
- Include the issue number or keywords in the branch name (e.g., `fix/header-issue-1`).

### Implementation & Verification
1. **Analysis**: Analyze the codebase to understand the context before making changes.
2. **Implementation**: Modify the code to satisfy the task requirements.
3. **Static Verification**:
   - Run `npm run lint` to check for code style and errors.
   - Run `npm run format` or `npm run format:check` to ensure formatting.
4. **Runtime Verification**:
   - Start the dev server (`npm run dev`).
   - Use the `@Browser` tool to verify the fix or feature visually.

## 3. Pull Request Automation

### Commit Strategy
- Follow Conventional Commits: `[Type] Description`.
- Stage only relevant files using `git add`.

### PR Creation
- Use `gh pr create` to generate the Pull Request.
- **Required Options**:
  - `--title`: "[Type] Description"
  - `--body`: Must include "Closes #IssueNumber" to link and auto-close the issue.
  - `--reviewer`: Assign the appropriate reviewer (e.g., `ByDeok`).
- **Example**:
  ```bash
  gh pr create --title "[Fix] Header responsive bug" --body "Closes #5" --reviewer ByDeok
  ```
